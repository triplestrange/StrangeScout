**The world's first free software [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://firstinspires.org) scouting system powered by Docker, Go, and the modern web (Angular2)!** Outputs data to a MariaDB database for easy access from commerical and free/libre/open-source tools such as LibreOffice Base, Tableau, Google Data Studio, and more! Authentication, web data analysis, user tracking, and more are all on the roadmap, available on the [Projects tab](https://github.com/triplestrange/StrangeScout/projects).

*Brought to you by your friends at **[Triple Strange #1533](http://ecgrobotics.org)!***

## Installation
## Docker Compose
Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/). Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Clone repo. Make a new `.env` file in the repo root (don't worry, it's in the `.gitignore`) as follows *(do not use quotes!)*:

If you want StrangeScout to talk directly to client's computers over the network (i.e. this is a dedicated server or virtual machine), run `ln -s docker-compose.standalone.yml docker-compose.yml`. If you need this server to be shared with other apps, you'll need a reverse proxy: we recommend (and support) [Traefik](https://github.com/containous/traefik). If you are using Traefik, execute `ln -s docker-compose.traefik.yml docker-compose.yml`

```
JSCOUT_DOMAIN=<yourdomain.tld>
STRANGESCOUT_SQL_PASSWD=<$ecure|)assw0rd>
# if you are using Traefik
TRAEFIK_NETWORK=<the_docker_network_traefik_is_on>
```

**Do `sudo ./build.sh`, then run `sudo docker-compose up -d` and sit back.** You're ready to scout... no, you're totally needed for maintenance and support and there's no way you'd have time to scout yourself right ;) HTTPS certs from Let's Encrypt and your SQL database are safely stored in Docker volumes, so you're free to start and stop containers at will, or even delete them!

**Needless to say, point DNS for `<yourdomain.tld>` to the IP of your server. Ensure that firewalls, AWS security groups, etc. have ports 80, 443, and 3306 (if you want remote SQL access) open. Enjoy!**

### Traefik Support
If you want to run using `traefik`, you must also set the `PREFIX`, `MYSQL_PUBLIC_PORT`, and `TRAEFIK_NETWORK` variables in your `.env` file.

## Usage
### SQL Access
Use an off-the-shelf program like [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io) to access your data. Choose the MariaDB database type and use `<yourdomain.tld>`, port 3306 (default), username `strangescout`, password `<$ecure|)assw0rd>`, and database `strangescout`. Works great with [Tableau](https://tableau.com) which is free for students and first teams!
